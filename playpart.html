        <h2>
            An Enemy of the People, by Henrik Ibsen
        </h2>
        <h5>1st Citizen (meeting another).</h5>
        
        <p> Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?</p>

           <h5> 2nd Citizen.</h5>
           
           <p>I go to every public meeting, I do.</p>
            
            <h5>3rd Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> Brought your whistle too, I expect!</p>
            
           <h5> 2nd Citizen.<h5>
            
            <p> I should think so. Haven't you?</p>
            
            <h5>3rd Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
            cow-horn, he did.</p>
            
            <h5>2nd Citizen.</h5> 
            
            <p>Good old Evensen!</p><p> (Laughter among the crowd.)</p>
            
           <h5> 4th Citizen</h5>
           
           <p> (coming up to them).</p><p> I say, tell me what is going on here
            tonight?</p>
            
            <h5>2nd Citizen.</h5> 
            
            <p>Dr. Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
            Mayor.</p>
            
           <h5> 4th Citizen.</h5>
           
           <p> But the Mayor is his brother.</p>
            
            <h5>1st Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
            afraid.</p>
            
            <h5>3rd Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> But he is in the wrong; it said so in the “People’s
            Messenger.”</p>
            
            <h5>2nd Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> Yes, I expect he must be in the wrong this time, because neither
            the Householders’ Association nor the Citizens’ Club would lend him
            their hall for his meeting.</p>
            
            <h5>1st Citizen.</h5>
            
            <p> He couldn’t even get the loan of the hall at the Baths.</p>
            
           <h5> 2nd Citizen.</h5> 
           
           <p>No, I should think not.</p>
            
           <p> A Man in another part of the crowd.</p>
           
           <p>I say—who are we to back up in this?Another Man, beside him.</p>
            
           <p>Watch Aslaksen, and do as he does.
